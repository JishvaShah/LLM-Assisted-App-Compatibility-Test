# LLM-Assisted-App-Compatibility-Test
The objective is to build and deploy a software application that takes in images of Android applications and report the state of the application to users. We plan to give the LLM the text of the app's screenshots before and after the login attempt, and ask the LLM to judge whether the login succeeded.
